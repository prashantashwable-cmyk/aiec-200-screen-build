Continue building **ALL INDIA ELEVATORS COMPANY (AIEC)**, the mobile-first, multi-role elevator business platform for owner Mr. Prashant Vasant Wable. The brief's 'then payment made to supplier & manufacturer' stage, built on real milestone-linked and retention-based terms so cash only moves when it should. Several screens already exist in this build — do not rebuild, restyle, or restructure anything outside this one screen. If you need a shared component (a button style, a card, the Ascension Line progress element, the map component), extend or reuse the existing one rather than creating a second, inconsistent version of it.

Now build the **Auto-Reconciliation Screen** screen, used by: **Admin**.

### Functional requirements
- Automated daily/periodic reconciliation check comparing bank account transactions against the app's recorded supplier payments, customer payments, and payouts, flagging any mismatch
- Clear pass/fail status per reconciliation run with drill-down into exactly which transaction(s) didn't match cleanly
- One-tap 'mark manually reconciled' for a legitimate mismatch that Admin has personally verified and explained (e.g., a bank fee that's outside the app's own transaction modeling)
- Historical reconciliation run log for audit purposes

### Data this screen touches
- `reconciliation_run_id`
- `run_date`
- `matched_count`
- `unmatched_transactions[]`
- `run_status`

### Business logic & automation rules
- This screen operationalizes real financial-control discipline appropriate for an 'enterprise-grade, production-ready' system as the brief demands — automated reconciliation is a standard safeguard ensuring the app's internal financial records genuinely reflect real money movement, not just internally-consistent-but-possibly-wrong bookkeeping
- An unmatched transaction here is treated with the same seriousness as any other exception in the app, surfacing into the Alerts & Exceptions Dashboard rather than being buried in a reconciliation-specific screen only Admin might remember to check separately
- This is deliberately one of the last-line financial-integrity checks in the entire system, complementing (not replacing) the three-way invoice matching and milestone-linked payment controls earlier in the payment lifecycle

### Edge cases & validation to handle
- A legitimate bank-side fee or minor rounding difference creates a small, expected mismatch: support Admin's manual reconciliation with a reason, distinct from a genuinely concerning unexplained discrepancy, so small expected differences don't create alert fatigue
- Bank feed/statement integration is temporarily unavailable: the reconciliation run should clearly report 'could not run, no bank data available' rather than silently reporting a false 'all matched' status due to having nothing to compare against
- A discrepancy is found that suggests a genuine error elsewhere in the app (e.g., a payment recorded twice): this should trigger a serious, high-priority exception given the direct financial-integrity implications, distinct in urgency from routine operational alerts

### UI / design requirements
**AIEC Design System — "Alabaster & Ascension" (premium royal-white theme)**
- Palette: Alabaster White #F8F6F1 base, pure White #FFFFFF cards, Charcoal Ink #2A2723 text, Antique Gold #B8873D primary accent, Royal Emerald #0E4B3D secondary accent. Keep Error Red #B23B3B reserved strictly for genuine errors/safety alerts — never decorative.
- Type (Latin/English): "Fraunces" (serif, Google Font) for headings/hero numbers, "Plus Jakarta Sans" (Google Font) for all UI/body text, "IBM Plex Mono" tabular figures for money and KPI numbers.
- Type (Devanagari/Hindi & Marathi): "Fraunces" and "Plus Jakarta Sans" do NOT cover Devanagari glyphs — never let Hindi/Marathi text silently fall back to a generic system font. Pair "Martel" (Google Font) for headings and "Hind" (Google Font) for UI/body text in Hindi or Marathi, matching the same heading/body weight relationship as the Latin pair. Keep IBM Plex Mono for all numerals in every language — India's digital finance UI uses Western digits (0-9) regardless of the surrounding script, so amounts don't need a separate numeral font per language. All user-facing text (labels, buttons, headings, messages, notification templates) must render in the user's selected language (English / Hindi / Marathi) via the app's translation system — never hardcoded in one language.
- Icons: Phosphor Icons or Lucide, thin 1.5px line-weight, rounded caps, tinted Royal Emerald by default and Antique Gold when active/selected.
- Cards: 16-20px corner radius, soft ambient shadow (never a harsh flat drop-shadow), 1px hairline border tinted gold at ~15% opacity.
- Grid: 8pt spacing throughout, mobile-first single column, 16-24px screen margins, sticky bottom action bar for primary CTAs, minimum 48x48px touch targets.
- Theme modes: build every color as a CSS custom property (`--color-bg`, `--color-surface`, `--color-text-primary`, `--color-text-secondary`, `--color-accent-primary`, `--color-accent-secondary`, `--color-success`, `--color-warning`, `--color-error`, `--color-border`) — never a hardcoded hex value in a component — so the whole app can switch instantly between 4 modes, stored as the signed-in user's own saved preference: **Light/Alabaster** (default — the warm-ivory palette above), **Snow White** (a crisper, cooler, brighter variant — pure `#FFFFFF` background, near-black `#1F2124` text, tighter shadows), **Dark** (warm near-black `#1A1815` background and `#242019` cards, soft off-white `#F0EDE6` text, and *brightened* accent colors — gold `#D4A855`, emerald `#2E9B78` — since the light-mode gold/emerald values lose contrast on a dark background), and **System** (follows the device's own OS-level light/dark setting). Full token values for all four modes live in `000_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — use them exactly, don't invent new ones per screen.
- Signature element — "the Ascension Line": a thin gold vertical rail that fills upward as progress is made, literally a stylized elevator floor-indicator. Use it for every stage-based UI in the app: CRM pipeline, installation SOP steps, onboarding wizards, training progress, negotiation rounds. This is the one motif that should appear, consistently styled, across the entire app, and it should use the `--color-accent-primary` token so it looks correct in every theme mode automatically.
- Motion: subtle and purposeful only — a completed Ascension Line step gets a brief warm glow, cards fade-and-rise on load. No bouncy/spring physics; this is a premium, safety-adjacent brand, not a playful consumer app.
- Voice: confident, clear, warm but not casual, in whichever of the three languages is active. Save exclamation marks for genuine celebratory moments (a deal won, a badge earned).

**Layout-specific guidance for this screen (layout pattern: dashboard):** Card-based grid: 2 columns on mobile, 3-4 on wider viewports. Give the single most important figure top-left reading position. Every KPI card follows the same anatomy — small label, large "Fraunces" or "IBM Plex Mono" number, small trend arrow with percentage — so the eye learns the pattern once and reads every card instantly thereafter. Every card should feel tappable (subtle shadow lift on press) and lead somewhere more detailed. Use skeleton-loading placeholders matching each card's real shape while data loads, never a blank space or a lone centered spinner. Support pull-to-refresh on mobile.

### This screen is done when:
- [ ] The app's financial records are continuously and automatically verified against real bank activity, not just assumed correct
- [ ] Any genuine discrepancy is caught and escalated with appropriate urgency, while small expected differences don't create noise
- [ ] The screen matches the AIEC Alabaster & Ascension design system (colors, type, the Ascension Line motif where applicable) rather than a generic default theme
- [ ] Loading, empty, and error states are all explicitly designed, not left blank or default
- [ ] The screen is fully usable at a mobile viewport width first, then adapted upward for wider screens

### Scope for this prompt
Touch only what's needed for the Auto-Reconciliation Screen screen and any shared component it must genuinely reuse. Do not modify unrelated screens, do not restyle already-built screens "while you're in there," and do not refactor the data model beyond what this screen genuinely requires. If a larger refactor actually seems necessary, stop and say so rather than doing it silently.

## Module 12 Checkpoint — before you start the next module

You've now finished all 10 screens in **Module 12: Supplier Payment Processing**. Before moving on to Module 13:

1. Click through every screen you just built in this module, start to finish, once, as if you were the actual user.
2. Spot-check 2-3 of the most important screens from earlier modules — you don't need to re-test everything back to Prompt 001, just confirm nothing visibly broke.
3. If anything looks wrong, send one more small, targeted prompt to fix it now. Don't carry a visible bug forward into the next module — regressions compound, and they're far cheaper to fix the moment you spot them than 50 screens later.
4. Optional but recommended: this is a natural point to download a ZIP backup or note your current AI Studio checkpoint/version, so you always have a known-good rollback point behind you.

This costs about two minutes and saves far more than that in confused debugging later.
