Continue building **ALL INDIA ELEVATORS COMPANY (AIEC)**, the mobile-first, multi-role elevator business platform for owner Mr. Prashant Vasant Wable. The brief's recruitment pipeline ends in 'trainings, SOP' — this module is where every partner actually learns the standards the rest of the app enforces. Several screens already exist in this build — do not rebuild, restyle, or restructure anything outside this one screen. If you need a shared component (a button style, a card, the Ascension Line progress element, the map component), extend or reuse the existing one rather than creating a second, inconsistent version of it.

Now build the **Training Feedback Screen** screen, used by: **Surveyor, Technician, Supplier**.

### Functional requirements
- Simple post-module feedback form: clarity rating, relevance rating, and an open comment field for suggestions or confusion points
- Aggregated view (for Admin, surfaced elsewhere) of feedback trends per module, helping continuously improve training content quality
- Anonymous option to encourage honest feedback, particularly for content partners found confusing or unhelpful
- Direct link from a specific confusing quiz question (from the Quiz screen's own dispute-flagging mechanism) into more detailed feedback here

### Data this screen touches
- `training_module_id`
- `partner_id_or_anonymous`
- `clarity_rating`
- `relevance_rating`
- `comment_text`

### Business logic & automation rules
- This feedback loop is the direct mechanism supporting continuous training-content improvement, closing the loop between 'partners are actually learning this' (Quiz results) and 'the content itself is genuinely good' (this screen's qualitative input), rather than training content being authored once and never revisited based on real learner experience
- Anonymous option is a deliberate design choice supporting genuinely honest feedback about training quality, since partners may otherwise hesitate to critique content if their feedback is directly attributable, especially regarding content authored by Admin themselves
- Aggregated feedback trends feed into the same content-versioning and update cycle used for SOP documents and training modules, ensuring feedback actually results in visible content improvement over time rather than being collected and forgotten

### Edge cases & validation to handle
- Feedback reveals a genuinely serious content error (e.g., factually incorrect safety information) rather than just a stylistic critique: this should be flagged with elevated urgency for immediate Admin review and correction, distinct from routine 'could be clearer' feedback
- Very low feedback response rate makes aggregated trends statistically unreliable: present with appropriate context about response rate rather than implying strong signal from sparse data
- A specific piece of feedback is abusive or clearly not constructive: support a lightweight moderation/filtering approach so genuine constructive feedback isn't drowned out, without discouraging honest critique in general

### UI / design requirements
**AIEC Design System — "Alabaster & Ascension" (premium royal-white theme)**
- Palette: Alabaster White #F8F6F1 base, pure White #FFFFFF cards, Charcoal Ink #2A2723 text, Antique Gold #B8873D primary accent, Royal Emerald #0E4B3D secondary accent. Keep Error Red #B23B3B reserved strictly for genuine errors/safety alerts — never decorative.
- Type (Latin/English): "Fraunces" (serif, Google Font) for headings/hero numbers, "Plus Jakarta Sans" (Google Font) for all UI/body text, "IBM Plex Mono" tabular figures for money and KPI numbers.
- Type (Devanagari/Hindi & Marathi): "Fraunces" and "Plus Jakarta Sans" do NOT cover Devanagari glyphs — never let Hindi/Marathi text silently fall back to a generic system font. Pair "Martel" (Google Font) for headings and "Hind" (Google Font) for UI/body text in Hindi or Marathi, matching the same heading/body weight relationship as the Latin pair. Keep IBM Plex Mono for all numerals in every language — India's digital finance UI uses Western digits (0-9) regardless of the surrounding script, so amounts don't need a separate numeral font per language. All user-facing text (labels, buttons, headings, messages, notification templates) must render in the user's selected language (English / Hindi / Marathi) via the app's translation system — never hardcoded in one language.
- Icons: Phosphor Icons or Lucide, thin 1.5px line-weight, rounded caps, tinted Royal Emerald by default and Antique Gold when active/selected.
- Cards: 16-20px corner radius, soft ambient shadow (never a harsh flat drop-shadow), 1px hairline border tinted gold at ~15% opacity.
- Grid: 8pt spacing throughout, mobile-first single column, 16-24px screen margins, sticky bottom action bar for primary CTAs, minimum 48x48px touch targets.
- Theme modes: build every color as a CSS custom property (`--color-bg`, `--color-surface`, `--color-text-primary`, `--color-text-secondary`, `--color-accent-primary`, `--color-accent-secondary`, `--color-success`, `--color-warning`, `--color-error`, `--color-border`) — never a hardcoded hex value in a component — so the whole app can switch instantly between 4 modes, stored as the signed-in user's own saved preference: **Light/Alabaster** (default — the warm-ivory palette above), **Snow White** (a crisper, cooler, brighter variant — pure `#FFFFFF` background, near-black `#1F2124` text, tighter shadows), **Dark** (warm near-black `#1A1815` background and `#242019` cards, soft off-white `#F0EDE6` text, and *brightened* accent colors — gold `#D4A855`, emerald `#2E9B78` — since the light-mode gold/emerald values lose contrast on a dark background), and **System** (follows the device's own OS-level light/dark setting). Full token values for all four modes live in `000_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — use them exactly, don't invent new ones per screen.
- Signature element — "the Ascension Line": a thin gold vertical rail that fills upward as progress is made, literally a stylized elevator floor-indicator. Use it for every stage-based UI in the app: CRM pipeline, installation SOP steps, onboarding wizards, training progress, negotiation rounds. This is the one motif that should appear, consistently styled, across the entire app, and it should use the `--color-accent-primary` token so it looks correct in every theme mode automatically.
- Motion: subtle and purposeful only — a completed Ascension Line step gets a brief warm glow, cards fade-and-rise on load. No bouncy/spring physics; this is a premium, safety-adjacent brand, not a playful consumer app.
- Voice: confident, clear, warm but not casual, in whichever of the three languages is active. Save exclamation marks for genuine celebratory moments (a deal won, a badge earned).

**Layout-specific guidance for this screen (layout pattern: form):** Single-column layout with generous label-above-input spacing following the 8pt grid. Validate inline as the user types wherever practical, not only on submit — show a small success check the instant a field like a phone number or IFSC code becomes valid. Group related fields under a subtle section header with a Gold Hairline divider rather than one undifferentiated long list. For any form with more than 4 fields, auto-save a draft so a partial entry is never lost to an app close or a connectivity drop. Primary action button sticky at the bottom on mobile, full-width, disabled (not hidden) until required fields are valid so the user always sees what's left to do.

### This screen is done when:
- [ ] Training content genuinely improves over time based on real learner feedback, not just being authored once and left static
- [ ] Serious content-quality issues (especially safety-related) are flagged with appropriate urgency, not lost among routine feedback
- [ ] The screen matches the AIEC Alabaster & Ascension design system (colors, type, the Ascension Line motif where applicable) rather than a generic default theme
- [ ] Loading, empty, and error states are all explicitly designed, not left blank or default
- [ ] The screen is fully usable at a mobile viewport width first, then adapted upward for wider screens

### Scope for this prompt
Touch only what's needed for the Training Feedback Screen screen and any shared component it must genuinely reuse. Do not modify unrelated screens, do not restyle already-built screens "while you're in there," and do not refactor the data model beyond what this screen genuinely requires. If a larger refactor actually seems necessary, stop and say so rather than doing it silently.

## Module 16 Checkpoint — before you start the next module

You've now finished all 10 screens in **Module 16: Training & SOP Library**. Before moving on to Module 17:

1. Click through every screen you just built in this module, start to finish, once, as if you were the actual user.
2. Spot-check 2-3 of the most important screens from earlier modules — you don't need to re-test everything back to Prompt 001, just confirm nothing visibly broke.
3. If anything looks wrong, send one more small, targeted prompt to fix it now. Don't carry a visible bug forward into the next module — regressions compound, and they're far cheaper to fix the moment you spot them than 50 screens later.
4. Optional but recommended: this is a natural point to download a ZIP backup or note your current AI Studio checkpoint/version, so you always have a known-good rollback point behind you.

This costs about two minutes and saves far more than that in confused debugging later.
