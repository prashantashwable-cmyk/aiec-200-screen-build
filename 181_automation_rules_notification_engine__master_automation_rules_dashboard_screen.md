Continue building **ALL INDIA ELEVATORS COMPANY (AIEC)**, the mobile-first, multi-role elevator business platform for owner Mr. Prashant Vasant Wable. The connective tissue implementing 'fully automated, only monitor by one person' as an actual configurable system rather than a marketing phrase. Several screens already exist in this build — do not rebuild, restyle, or restructure anything outside this one screen. If you need a shared component (a button style, a card, the Ascension Line progress element, the map component), extend or reuse the existing one rather than creating a second, inconsistent version of it.

Now build the **Master Automation Rules Dashboard Screen** screen, used by: **Admin**.

### Functional requirements
- Single overview of every automation rule active across the entire app (communication sequences, payment reminders, PO triggers, training refresher reminders, contest lifecycle management), regardless of which specific module each rule technically lives in
- Health status per rule category, directly feeding from and consistent with the Automation Health Monitor already defined in the Admin Analytics module
- Quick toggle to pause/resume any rule category in an emergency without navigating into that rule's own dedicated configuration screen
- Recent rule-triggered activity log across the whole system

### Data this screen touches
- `rule_category`
- `active_rule_count`
- `health_status`
- `last_triggered_activity`
- `global_pause_toggle`

### Business logic & automation rules
- This dashboard is a genuine cross-module aggregation view, since automation rules are deliberately configured within their own relevant functional module (Communication rules in the Communication Engine, PO trigger rules in Supplier Management) for contextual clarity, but Admin also needs one unified place to see the whole automated system's health at a glance, consistent with the brief's single-person-monitoring model
- The global emergency pause toggle here is a deliberately blunt, fast-acting safety mechanism — sometimes the fastest right action in a genuine emergency is 'stop everything in this category right now' rather than navigating to a specific configuration screen, even though the underlying detailed configuration still lives in its proper contextual home
- This dashboard's health status must always exactly match the Automation Health Monitor screen already defined in the Admin Analytics module — they represent the same underlying telemetry, this view simply organizes it by rule category across the whole system rather than by individual automation instance

### Edge cases & validation to handle
- An emergency pause is used to stop a rule category, but some in-flight processes were already partway through executing: define clear behavior for exactly what a pause does and doesn't retroactively affect, so Admin has an accurate mental model of the pause's real effect
- Rule categories from a newly added module (as the business grows and new functionality is added) need to appear here automatically: design this dashboard to aggregate dynamically from whatever rule categories exist, rather than a fixed list needing manual updates every time a new feature ships
- Very high overall automation activity volume across the whole system: ensure the recent-activity log remains a genuinely useful, appropriately summarized view rather than an overwhelming raw firehose

### UI / design requirements
**AIEC Design System — "Alabaster & Ascension" (premium royal-white theme)**
- Palette: Alabaster White #F8F6F1 base, pure White #FFFFFF cards, Charcoal Ink #2A2723 text, Antique Gold #B8873D primary accent, Royal Emerald #0E4B3D secondary accent. Keep Error Red #B23B3B reserved strictly for genuine errors/safety alerts — never decorative.
- Type (Latin/English): "Fraunces" (serif, Google Font) for headings/hero numbers, "Plus Jakarta Sans" (Google Font) for all UI/body text, "IBM Plex Mono" tabular figures for money and KPI numbers.
- Type (Devanagari/Hindi & Marathi): "Fraunces" and "Plus Jakarta Sans" do NOT cover Devanagari glyphs — never let Hindi/Marathi text silently fall back to a generic system font. Pair "Martel" (Google Font) for headings and "Hind" (Google Font) for UI/body text in Hindi or Marathi, matching the same heading/body weight relationship as the Latin pair. Keep IBM Plex Mono for all numerals in every language — India's digital finance UI uses Western digits (0-9) regardless of the surrounding script, so amounts don't need a separate numeral font per language. All user-facing text (labels, buttons, headings, messages, notification templates) must render in the user's selected language (English / Hindi / Marathi) via the app's translation system — never hardcoded in one language.
- Icons: Phosphor Icons or Lucide, thin 1.5px line-weight, rounded caps, tinted Royal Emerald by default and Antique Gold when active/selected.
- Cards: 16-20px corner radius, soft ambient shadow (never a harsh flat drop-shadow), 1px hairline border tinted gold at ~15% opacity.
- Grid: 8pt spacing throughout, mobile-first single column, 16-24px screen margins, sticky bottom action bar for primary CTAs, minimum 48x48px touch targets.
- Theme modes: build every color as a CSS custom property (`--color-bg`, `--color-surface`, `--color-text-primary`, `--color-text-secondary`, `--color-accent-primary`, `--color-accent-secondary`, `--color-success`, `--color-warning`, `--color-error`, `--color-border`) — never a hardcoded hex value in a component — so the whole app can switch instantly between 4 modes, stored as the signed-in user's own saved preference: **Light/Alabaster** (default — the warm-ivory palette above), **Snow White** (a crisper, cooler, brighter variant — pure `#FFFFFF` background, near-black `#1F2124` text, tighter shadows), **Dark** (warm near-black `#1A1815` background and `#242019` cards, soft off-white `#F0EDE6` text, and *brightened* accent colors — gold `#D4A855`, emerald `#2E9B78` — since the light-mode gold/emerald values lose contrast on a dark background), and **System** (follows the device's own OS-level light/dark setting). Full token values for all four modes live in `000_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — use them exactly, don't invent new ones per screen.
- Signature element — "the Ascension Line": a thin gold vertical rail that fills upward as progress is made, literally a stylized elevator floor-indicator. Use it for every stage-based UI in the app: CRM pipeline, installation SOP steps, onboarding wizards, training progress, negotiation rounds. This is the one motif that should appear, consistently styled, across the entire app, and it should use the `--color-accent-primary` token so it looks correct in every theme mode automatically.
- Motion: subtle and purposeful only — a completed Ascension Line step gets a brief warm glow, cards fade-and-rise on load. No bouncy/spring physics; this is a premium, safety-adjacent brand, not a playful consumer app.
- Voice: confident, clear, warm but not casual, in whichever of the three languages is active. Save exclamation marks for genuine celebratory moments (a deal won, a badge earned).

**Layout-specific guidance for this screen (layout pattern: dashboard):** Card-based grid: 2 columns on mobile, 3-4 on wider viewports. Give the single most important figure top-left reading position. Every KPI card follows the same anatomy — small label, large "Fraunces" or "IBM Plex Mono" number, small trend arrow with percentage — so the eye learns the pattern once and reads every card instantly thereafter. Every card should feel tappable (subtle shadow lift on press) and lead somewhere more detailed. Use skeleton-loading placeholders matching each card's real shape while data loads, never a blank space or a lone centered spinner. Support pull-to-refresh on mobile.

### This screen is done when:
- [ ] Admin has one true, comprehensive view of the entire automated system's health and activity
- [ ] An emergency pause capability exists and behaves predictably, without needing to hunt through multiple separate configuration screens during a crisis
- [ ] The screen matches the AIEC Alabaster & Ascension design system (colors, type, the Ascension Line motif where applicable) rather than a generic default theme
- [ ] Loading, empty, and error states are all explicitly designed, not left blank or default
- [ ] The screen is fully usable at a mobile viewport width first, then adapted upward for wider screens

### Scope for this prompt
Touch only what's needed for the Master Automation Rules Dashboard Screen screen and any shared component it must genuinely reuse. Do not modify unrelated screens, do not restyle already-built screens "while you're in there," and do not refactor the data model beyond what this screen genuinely requires. If a larger refactor actually seems necessary, stop and say so rather than doing it silently.
