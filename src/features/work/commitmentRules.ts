/**
 * The manager's rulebook: every dated promise the business runs on, as data.
 *
 * Each rule reads records that already exist and says, per obligation, who
 * owns it, when it's due, and whether it's still open. Nothing here stores
 * state or sends anything — `runFollowUpEngine` (memoryRepository.ts) turns
 * these into persisted Commitments and walks the nudge → overdue → escalate
 * ladder. That split is what lets the same rules run on a server scheduler
 * later without change.
 *
 * Chains ("follow-up completion of work") fall out of the records rather
 * than being wired by hand: sending a PO closes `po_send` and the same
 * record now yields `po_acknowledge` and `po_delivery`. A chain can't drift
 * out of step with the data, because it *is* the data.
 *
 * A new screen that introduces a new dated obligation adds a rule here.
