Continue building **ALL INDIA ELEVATORS COMPANY (AIEC)**, the mobile-first, multi-role elevator business platform for owner Mr. Prashant Vasant Wable. The brief's automated payment follow-up plus a loan/financing option to collect the full amount sooner — modeled on real Indian AMC/GST/EMI conventions. Several screens already exist in this build — do not rebuild, restyle, or restructure anything outside this one screen. If you need a shared component (a button style, a card, the Ascension Line progress element, the map component), extend or reuse the existing one rather than creating a second, inconsistent version of it.

Now build the **Payment Stage Schedule Setup Screen** screen, used by: **Admin, Sales**.

### Functional requirements
- Auto-populated from the payment stage plan locked in during Deal Terms Finalization, editable only within the bounds that plan allows (e.g., splitting a stage further, not changing the total)
- Standard stage presets (e.g., Booking Advance, Material Order Payment, Pre-Installation Payment, Final Handover Payment) with customizable percentages per stage
- Due-date logic tied to milestone events (e.g., 'due on material delivery confirmation') rather than only fixed calendar dates, where that better fits the business process
- Preview of the full schedule as the customer will see it in their portal

### Data this screen touches
- `deal_id`
- `stage_name`
- `stage_amount`
- `stage_due_trigger`
- `stage_sequence_order`

### Business logic & automation rules
- This schedule, once activated, becomes the exact trigger source read by the Automated Payment Reminder engine and the Overdue Payment Escalation screen — there's no separate schedule maintained anywhere else
- Stage amounts must sum exactly to the final agreed price locked in at Deal Terms Finalization; the screen blocks activation if they don't reconcile
- Milestone-triggered due dates (e.g., tied to Material Received Confirmation) automatically populate the actual due date the moment that milestone event fires elsewhere in the app, rather than needing manual date entry later

### Edge cases & validation to handle
- Customer negotiates a genuinely custom stage structure (e.g., 6 stages instead of the standard 4): support full customization within the total-must-reconcile constraint, rather than forcing only the presets
- A milestone the schedule depends on (e.g., delivery confirmation) is itself delayed: the due date shifts accordingly and automatically, rather than creating a due date that's already overdue the moment it's set
- Very large commercial deal wants a bank-guarantee-backed schedule rather than the standard structure: allow a documented custom schedule type flagged for Admin's direct oversight

### UI / design requirements
**AIEC Design System — "Alabaster & Ascension" (premium royal-white theme)**
- Palette: Alabaster White #F8F6F1 base, pure White #FFFFFF cards, Charcoal Ink #2A2723 text, Antique Gold #B8873D primary accent, Royal Emerald #0E4B3D secondary accent. Keep Error Red #B23B3B reserved strictly for genuine errors/safety alerts — never decorative.
- Type (Latin/English): "Fraunces" (serif, Google Font) for headings/hero numbers, "Plus Jakarta Sans" (Google Font) for all UI/body text, "IBM Plex Mono" tabular figures for money and KPI numbers.
- Type (Devanagari/Hindi & Marathi): "Fraunces" and "Plus Jakarta Sans" do NOT cover Devanagari glyphs — never let Hindi/Marathi text silently fall back to a generic system font. Pair "Martel" (Google Font) for headings and "Hind" (Google Font) for UI/body text in Hindi or Marathi, matching the same heading/body weight relationship as the Latin pair. Keep IBM Plex Mono for all numerals in every language — India's digital finance UI uses Western digits (0-9) regardless of the surrounding script, so amounts don't need a separate numeral font per language. All user-facing text (labels, buttons, headings, messages, notification templates) must render in the user's selected language (English / Hindi / Marathi) via the app's translation system — never hardcoded in one language.
- Icons: Phosphor Icons or Lucide, thin 1.5px line-weight, rounded caps, tinted Royal Emerald by default and Antique Gold when active/selected.
- Cards: 16-20px corner radius, soft ambient shadow (never a harsh flat drop-shadow), 1px hairline border tinted gold at ~15% opacity.
- Grid: 8pt spacing throughout, mobile-first single column, 16-24px screen margins, sticky bottom action bar for primary CTAs, minimum 48x48px touch targets.
- Theme modes: build every color as a CSS custom property (`--color-bg`, `--color-surface`, `--color-text-primary`, `--color-text-secondary`, `--color-accent-primary`, `--color-accent-secondary`, `--color-success`, `--color-warning`, `--color-error`, `--color-border`) — never a hardcoded hex value in a component — so the whole app can switch instantly between 7 modes, stored as the signed-in user's own saved preference: **Light/Alabaster** (default — the warm-ivory palette above), **Snow White** (a crisper, cooler, brighter variant — pure `#FFFFFF` background, near-black `#1F2124` text, tighter shadows), **Dark** (warm near-black `#1A1815` background and `#242019` cards, soft off-white `#F0EDE6` text, brightened gold `#D4A855` and emerald `#2E9B78` accents), **Orbital** (a mission-control mood — deep space-black `#0B0E14` background, monospace telemetry-style labels, a fine dot-grid texture, brightened gold `#D9AE5C` and emerald `#35B48A` accents), **Lithium** (a matte, automotive-dashboard mood — flat near-black `#101012` surfaces, oversized clean numerals, desaturated matte gold `#C99A52` and emerald `#2E8968` accents, almost no shadow), **Pure** (an extreme-minimalist mood — pure white `#FFFFFF` background, hairline dividers instead of shadows, maximum whitespace, the same gold `#B8873D`/emerald `#0E4B3D` as Light mode used far more sparingly), and **System** (follows the device's own OS-level light/dark setting, mapping to Light/Alabaster or Dark). All 7 modes keep the *same* AIEC gold-and-emerald brand identity underneath — only mood, texture, density, and typography change between them, never the core brand colors, so the app never looks like it's borrowed someone else's visual identity. Full token values for all seven modes live in `000_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — use them exactly, don't invent new ones per screen.
- Signature element — "the Ascension Line": a thin gold vertical rail that fills upward as progress is made, literally a stylized elevator floor-indicator. Use it for every stage-based UI in the app: CRM pipeline, installation SOP steps, onboarding wizards, training progress, negotiation rounds. This is the one motif that should appear, consistently styled, across the entire app, and it should use the `--color-accent-primary` token so it looks correct in every theme mode automatically.
- Motion: subtle and purposeful only — a completed Ascension Line step gets a brief warm glow, cards fade-and-rise on load. No bouncy/spring physics; this is a premium, safety-adjacent brand, not a playful consumer app.
- Voice: confident, clear, warm but not casual, in whichever of the three languages is active. Save exclamation marks for genuine celebratory moments (a deal won, a badge earned).

**Layout-specific guidance for this screen (layout pattern: form):** Single-column layout with generous label-above-input spacing following the 8pt grid. Validate inline as the user types wherever practical, not only on submit — show a small success check the instant a field like a phone number or IFSC code becomes valid. Group related fields under a subtle section header with a Gold Hairline divider rather than one undifferentiated long list. For any form with more than 4 fields, auto-save a draft so a partial entry is never lost to an app close or a connectivity drop. Primary action button sticky at the bottom on mobile, full-width, disabled (not hidden) until required fields are valid so the user always sees what's left to do.

### This screen is done when:
- [ ] Every payment stage's due date and trigger logic is unambiguous and consistently read by every downstream reminder and escalation process
- [ ] Stage amounts always reconcile exactly to the total deal value
- [ ] The screen matches the AIEC Alabaster & Ascension design system (colors, type, the Ascension Line motif where applicable) rather than a generic default theme
- [ ] Loading, empty, and error states are all explicitly designed, not left blank or default
- [ ] The screen is fully usable at a mobile viewport width first, then adapted upward for wider screens

### Scope for this prompt
Touch only what's needed for the Payment Stage Schedule Setup Screen screen and any shared component it must genuinely reuse. Do not modify unrelated screens, do not restyle already-built screens "while you're in there," and do not refactor the data model beyond what this screen genuinely requires. If a larger refactor actually seems necessary, stop and say so rather than doing it silently.
