# AIEC — Production Conversion Audit (Step 1)

Date: 2026-10-07 · Branch `claude/production-build-stage` · Baseline commit `c64b875`

This is the audit the build-stage prompt asks for before any feature code. Every
finding below comes from a command that was run against this repository; the
commands are listed in the appendix so anyone can re-run them.

---

## 0. The one-paragraph answer

This is **not** a screen gallery. 194 of the 200 numbered screens call real
business logic (876 repository methods, 92 heartbeat units, 143 commitment
rules) that validates input, enforces role rules, writes append-only records
and raises alerts. Navigation, guards, 404, three languages and seven themes
are real. What is missing is underneath the UI: **there is no server and no
database.** All data lives in one JavaScript object in the browser tab
(`src/data/memoryRepository.ts`, 33,041 lines) and is rebuilt from seed on
every page load. So nothing a user does survives a refresh, nothing is shared
between two people on two phones, and every rule the app "enforces" is
enforced in the browser, where it can be bypassed. Sign-in accepts a
hard-coded code. The conversion is therefore mostly **one large job (a real
backend behind the existing `Repository` interface)** plus a short list of
specific fakes, not 200 screen rewrites.

---

## Progress since this audit

**S0a (fixes that need no backend) is done** — commits a576a32…e9a9a8c and the one after. The per-screen CSV now reads 199
Real (in-memory), 1 Static (001 splash), 0 Partial. What changed:

| Finding | Now |
|---|---|
| 005 / 006 sign-ups saved nothing | Saved as a pending account with documents, skills, zones, PAN, payout account; Admin decides on 004 (approval assigns the surveyor's zones); commitment `onboarding_review` |
| 008 customer confirmation saved nothing | Creates or links the account, applies corrections, links the won deal, records SMS / WhatsApp choices as opt-out events; the fake "password" option is gone |
| Full Aadhaar stored (142) | Only the last four digits and "checksum passed" are kept; the repository reduces or refuses anything longer |
| 020 job assignment saved nothing; workload from rating; hard-coded "on leave" | `assignJobLead` with the same checks as every other way onto a job; real open work; real reasons (training, tier, leave, booked, skill) |
| Supplier home was a "module pending" placeholder (found during S0a; the audit had called `/supplier` a leftover) | Supplier home is Orders (095) |
| Refused route bounced home silently; 404 reloaded the page | "Not open to you" page; 404 navigates in-app |
| Role audit, alert snooze/delegation, saved reports, supplier watchlist in one browser's storage | In the repository; delegation tells the person and moves the follow-up to them |
| 026 trend drawn from a hash of the supplier id; "two months below" invented (found during S0a) | Trend removed; watchlist reads two real months of rated deliveries |
| 030 promised scheduled sending and failure alerts (found during S0a) | Control removed; screen says a delivery connection is not set up |
| 005 / 007 "Account verified", "GSTIN verified" after a timer | Real checks kept; the screens say the bank check and registry lookup are not connected |
| Seven copies of the phone rule | One module, `@/features/validation/india` |

**S0b (tests, guard, CI) is done.** What changed:

| Finding | Now |
|---|---|
| No tests, no CI | Vitest (`npm test`, 40 tests: validators, money rules, GST / TDS, audit chain, and the repository's own guarantees through the `Repository` interface, so the same file can run against the real backend); Playwright smoke per role (`npm run test:e2e`: every role signs in through the real login, Admin through the second step, and opens its key screens; a technician is refused an Admin screen); GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs typecheck, translations, guard, tests, build and the smoke on every push and PR |
| Nothing stopped a fake coming back | `npm run guard` (`scripts/no-mock-guard.mjs`) fails on `Math.random`, a timer standing in for work, a number derived from an id, placeholder text, dead links / buttons, `alert(`, `console.log`, TODO / FIXME in `src/` (seed data and translations excepted); a line that truly needs one ends with `// no-mock-guard: <reason>` |
| H6: recovery codes and other secrets from `Math.random`; 13 copies of a `Math.random` client id | `@/features/ids/clientId` (crypto: `newClientId`, `randomToken`, `randomCode`); every copy replaced |
| Simulated network latency (220–520 ms) applied to every read and write | Development only; 0 in a production build |
| **Technician quality score, on-time rate and days per job computed from the characters of the user id** (found in S0b). It fed 121's quality score, 024's ranking and 148's tier criteria | Read from records: first-attempt pass share of the independent QC checks (132 / 133) on jobs they led; start-to-finish against the planned duration; "not rated yet" when nothing is on record |
| Surveyor response time from the id's characters (found in S0b) | Median hours from capture to first contact on record; none when nothing is recorded |
| 024 sparkline and "rising stars" from a hash of the user id; the period selector did nothing (found in S0b) | Real weekly counts (wins, revenue, finished jobs); rising stars = last 4 weeks against the 4 before, only a real rise takes a place; the period filter applies to counts (a rate says it is all time); "not rated yet" takes no place or medal |
| 027 failure reasons picked by `rule.id.charCodeAt(0) + i` (found in S0b) | The error the step itself recorded (181's telemetry), or "the step kept no reason" |

**S0c (database foundation) is done.** The app does not use it yet; modules move onto it from S1.

| Piece | What exists now |
|---|---|
| Supabase project files | `supabase/config.toml` (phone sign-in on, Mumbai-ready) and four migrations in `supabase/migrations` |
| Identity | `profiles`: phone (last 10 digits are the person), role, status, demo or real. First sign-in links a phone Admin already added, else creates a pending profile with no role. Only Admin changes role / status / phone; demo or real is fixed; the last active Admin cannot stop being one; nothing is ever deleted |
| Row-level rules | A person sees only themself; Admin sees their own world (real or demo, never both); anonymous sees nothing |
| Audit log on the server | `audit_events`: SHA-256 chain set by the database (sequence, time and actor can't be chosen by the browser), refused for update / delete / truncate by everyone, `app.verify_audit_chain()` names the first broken entry |
| Server clock | `app.heartbeat()` every minute by pg_cron: records the beat and checks the log; a break is written to the log once |
| File stores | private `evidence` and `documents` buckets, each person files under their own folder, Admin reads all |
| Proof | 21 database tests (`npm run test:db`) on plain Postgres 16 and on Supabase's own Postgres 17; an end-to-end run through Supabase's sign-in service and REST API with signed tokens (a technician cannot make themself Admin, a forged log entry is stored as theirs, Admin cannot edit the log, a pending newcomer cannot write); CI runs the database tests on every push |
| Owner steps | `docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md`; `.github/workflows/db-deploy.yml` sends the migrations to the live project from repository secrets |

Still open: everything in S1 onwards, and the items in `KNOWN_GAPS.md`.

## Conflict with the build-stage prompt (read first)

The prompt's "Product context" describes a different product: a map-first,
event-sourced lift platform for Pune with roles Scout, Sales Executive, QC
Inspector, Installer, Logistics, NBFC, Mentor, Applicant, Owner, and "Admin
only monitors". This repository is AIEC as specified by its own 200 numbered
specs (`001_…md`–`200_…md`) and `000_*` foundation docs: five base roles
(Admin, Surveyor, Technician, Customer, Supplier), custom roles (192), and
Admin as the owner's operating role. The "specification produced by
MVP_Master_Prompt.txt" was not provided and is not in the repo.

| # | Prompt says | Repo / its own spec says | Proposed handling |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | 12 roles incl. Scout, NBFC, Mentor, Owner | 5 base roles + custom roles (192) | Keep repo roles. Owner = Admin; QC Inspector already exists as a custom role (`cr-1`). Add others only if the missing spec asks. |
| C2 | Map is every role's home | Each role has its own home (021/031/121/171/supplier) | Keep. Changing homes is a redesign, which Ground Rule 1 forbids. |
| C3 | "Admin only monitors; Owner decides" | Admin approves, configures, overrides (spec 163, 188, 192…) | Keep. Needs the missing spec to change. |
| C4 | Event-sourced, hash-chained event store for everything | Domain records + append-only histories per record; one hash-chained log for automated actions (187) | Keep records; extend the hash chain to a server-side event table (S0/S3). |
| C5 | "Pin fuzzing", "exact coordinates before acceptance" | No fuzzing concept in the repo's specs | Add server-side only if the missing spec defines it. |
| C6 | Partners are independent contractors; facilitation fee | Commission/payout model (161–170) | Keep repo model. |

The prompt says "where code and specification disagree, follow the
specification". The only specification available is the repo's own, so this
audit follows it and lists the above as open decisions.

## A. Mock inventory

The full per-screen table (200 rows, machine-generated, re-runnable with
`node scripts/mock-inventory.mjs`) is in
[`docs/audit/mock-inventory.csv`](docs/audit/mock-inventory.csv): screen,
slug, route, roles, status, repository calls, states present, signals, local
storage keys, lines of code.

### Status counts

| Status | Count | Meaning here |
|---|---|---|
| Real (in-memory) | 194 | Calls repository logic; behaves correctly while the tab is open; lost on refresh |
| Partial | 5 | Contains a fake delay presented as work (005, 006, 007, 008, 009) |
| Static | 1 | 001 splash — correct, it has nothing to load |
| Mock / Missing | 0 numbered screens; the supplier's home route (`/supplier` → `ModulePendingScreen`, `src/App.tsx:109`) — every supplier login landed there |

**Uniform finding for all 194 "Real" screens:** backend needed = the real
repository (S0); events = whatever they already write to the in-memory store,
moved server-side. Effort is in S0, not per screen.

### Specific fakes (the rows that need individual work)

| Screen / route | File | Status | Exactly what is fake | Backend needed | Effort | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 005 `/onboarding/surveyor` | `useOnboardSurveyor.ts:120` | **Partial — data loss** | `submit()` waits 700 ms, shows "submitted", **deletes the draft and saves nothing**. The applicant is told their application is with AIEC. | `createPartnerApplication`/`submitSurveyorOnboarding` | S | **P0** |
| 006 `/onboarding/technician` | `useOnboardTechnician.ts:104` | **Partial — data loss** | Same as 005. | same | S | **P0** |
| 008 `/onboarding/customer` | `useOnboardCustomer.ts:110,120` | Partial | Confirm and "link to existing account" wait 600/500 ms and save nothing (consent flags are not recorded). | `confirmCustomerAccount`, `linkCustomerAccount` | S | P0 |
| 005, 007 penny-drop | `useOnboardSurveyor.ts:110`, `useOnboardSupplier.ts:98` | Simulated | ₹1 bank verification: account ending `0` fails, else "verified" after 1.4 s. | Bank-verification provider | M | P1 (gate behind flag) |
| 007 GSTIN lookup | `useOnboardSupplier.ts:86` | Simulated | GSTIN ending `9` = "registry unreachable", else "matched". | GST registry API (GSP) | M | P1 (gate) |
| 009 `/forgot-password` | `useForgotPassword.ts:177` | Partial | 700 ms cosmetic delay; the reset *is* recorded, but sign-in is OTP-only so a password is never used. | Decide: drop passwords or add password auth | S | P2 |
| 003 `/login/otp` | `otp.types.ts:30` | **Fake auth** | OTP is the constant `123456`, checked in the browser. No SMS is sent. | Phone-OTP provider + server session | M | **P0** |
| 195 second step | `features/security/security.ts` (`DEMO_SECOND_CODE` 246810) | Fake auth (disclosed on screen) | Second-factor code is a constant shown on the gate. | TOTP/SMS | M | P1 |
| 020 route optimisation | `useRouteOptimize.ts:107` | Odd code | `Math.random() * 0 + …` — deterministic, but reads like random data. | none | S | P3 |
| `/supplier` | `App.tsx:109` | Missing | Leftover `ModulePendingScreen` route from before Module 10. | none (remove or redirect) | S | P3 |
| All data reads/writes | `src/data/repository.ts:10093-10104` | Simulated latency | `simulateRead`/`simulateWrite` add 220–520 ms of random delay to every call. | Real network latency replaces it | — | goes with S0 |

### Stand-ins that are honest already (disclosed on screen)

30 screens state on screen that a provider is not connected (e.g. 076
e-signature, 084 gateway, 102 GPS, 164 payout bank, 184 escalation gateway, 186
probes, 189 credentials, 196 backup service). These meet Ground Rule 3's "honest
not-connected state"; they become real only when each provider is chosen
(section G). List: 002 011 014 032 040 076 083 089 094 112 116 120 138 142 143
145 152 155 164 165 167 168 182 183 184 186 189 190 195 196.

### Banned-pattern scan (prompt's list)

| Pattern | Hits in `src/` | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| lorem, faker, dummy | 0 | clean |
| `href="#"`, `onClick={() => {}}` | 0 | clean |
| `alert(`, `console.log` | 0 | clean |
| TODO / FIXME | 0 | clean |
| `setTimeout(resolve, N)` as latency | 9 lines in 5 screens + the global `simulate*` | listed above |
| `Math.random(` | 19 | 15 are client id generation (fine), 1 recovery-code generator (move server-side), 2 the global latency simulator, 1 the `* 0` oddity in 020 |
| `localStorage.setItem` | 84 | mostly drafts/preferences (fine); **6 are domain data** — see C |

---

## B. Navigation audit

| Check | Finding |
|---|---|
| Routes | 200 `route.tsx` files globbed by `src/navigation/registry.ts`; duplicate paths are reported in dev. Real. |
| Guards | `RequireSession` (waits while a stored session restores, so refresh/deep-link do not bounce) and `RoleGuard` → `useAccess().canOpen` (192's permission table). **Client-side only.** |
| 403 | No 403 page: a refused route silently redirects to the role's home (`App.tsx:56`). Should show "not allowed" with a way home. |
| 404 | `NotFound` exists, but uses `window.location.href` (`App.tsx:69`), which reloads the page and **wipes the in-memory store**. Use `navigate`. |
| Dead ends | Many screens are reachable only by URL, alerts or the assistant (documented per screen in CLAUDE.md, e.g. 181, 183, 185–190, 193–200, 177, 175 for Admin). Not dead, but undiscoverable. |
| Back stack / deep links | Filters and sheets live in the URL (`?tab=`, `?entry=` …) on most list screens, so links and Back work. A deep link works after sign-in only within one page load for data created in that session. |

## C. State audit

| Where | What | Survives refresh? |
|---|---|---|
| `memoryRepository.ts` module scope | **All domain data** | **No** — reseeded on every load |
| `sessionStorage` `aiec.session`, `aiec.authSession` | Who is signed in | Yes (tab only) |
| `localStorage` drafts (~25 keys: `aiec.*Draft.*`, outboxes) | Unsent form text, offline queues | Yes (device only) — appropriate |
| `localStorage` **domain data used as a database** | `aiec.savedReports` (030), `aiec.snoozedAlerts` + `aiec.delegatedAlerts` (029), `aiec.supplierWatchlist` (026), `aiec.roleAudit` (004), `aiec.queuedLeadSubmissions` (036, an outbox — fine once a server exists) | Device only; invisible to other users; banned by Ground Rule 3 |

Consequence: an offline outbox that is replayed into a store that was itself
wiped on reload can "succeed" against data that no longer exists. Once S0
lands, every outbox needs server-side idempotency keys (most already send a
`clientId`).

Duplication: the store is single-source (screens derive on read — a strength),
but **validation regexes are duplicated** in 7 places (phone in
`login.types.ts:61`, `onboarding/validators.ts:74`, `recruitment/interest.ts:44`,
`security/security.ts:171`, `escalation/matrix.ts:184`,
`memoryRepository.ts:15036`, `businessCardOcr.ts:23`).

## D. Forms audit

Validation is real and usually shared between screen and repository (pure rule
modules in `src/features/*`). India-specific coverage:

| Rule | Present | Where | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mobile (10 digits, starts 6–9, optional +91) | Yes | 7 copies (above) | Consolidate into one schema |
| PIN code | Partial | onboarding | Not checked on lead address (032/033) |
| GSTIN (format + state code) | Yes | `features/tax/gst.ts`, `brand.ts`, `onboarding/validators.ts` | Check digit not verified (said on 191) |
| PAN | Yes | `onboarding/validators.ts`, 169 masks it | — |
| IFSC | Yes | onboarding, 164 | — |
| UPI ID | Yes | 164 | — |
| **Aadhaar** | **Number stored in full** | `types.ts:2691` `PartnerApplication.identity.aadhaarNumber` (142); validated with Verhoeff, masked on display | **Must not be stored** (UIDAI rules). Keep only last 4 + a reference/token from an offline-KYC/DigiLocker flow. **P0.** |

There is no single shared schema library (e.g. Zod) usable by both a client and
a server; the pure rule modules are the closest thing and are reusable as-is in
a Node/edge backend.

## E. Data audit

- Entities: 521 exported types/interfaces in `src/data/types.ts` (6,407 lines) backing 876
  repository methods. Every one carries `isDemo`.
- `firebase.ts` lists only 13 collections — out of date by ~180 screens.
- Screens without spec: none (every screen maps 1:1 to `NNN_*.md`).
- Spec without screens: none in the repo's own spec. Versus the prompt's
  product: Scout/NBFC/Mentor/Logistics roles, pin fuzzing, Owner Decision
  Desk, Autonomy Dials, Class 1/2/3 corrections — not present (see C1–C6).
- Seed: `seed.ts` (4,518 lines) + lazy per-module seeds inside
  `memoryRepository.ts` (`*Ensure`, `*Seeds`). Demo and production data are
  separable by `isDemo`, but nothing enforces it.

## F. States matrix (summary; per screen in the CSV `states` column)

| State | Screens with it |
|---|---|
| Loading | 187 / 200 |
| Error | 187 / 200 |
| Empty | 160 / 200 (the rest are forms/wizards/detail screens where "empty" is not a state) |
| Offline | Designed on the field screens: 036, 103/104, 123–130, 151–153, 175–176 (outbox + "not sent yet"). Not on Admin screens. |
| No-permission (403) | None (silent redirect) |
| Conflict (someone else changed it) | Present where it matters in-memory: 122 spec-changed banner, 182/191/194/195/198 preview tokens (`preview_stale`), 193 `panel_changed`. No general optimistic-concurrency (row version) because there is one writer. |

The 13 screens without loading/error (001 002 003 006 007 009 010 018 032 033
034 036 050) are auth, wizards and capture steps that load nothing on arrival;
006 and 009 should still show a submit error (they do via phase/status, not the
shared `ErrorState`).

## G. Integrations audit

No `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest` or SDK call exists anywhere in `src/`. Everything
external is either a stand-in or a hand-off URL.

| Integration | State | Recommendation (indicative INR, to verify) |
|---|---|---|
| Phone OTP auth | **Fake** (`123456`) | Supabase Auth phone OTP via MSG91 / Twilio Verify; MSG91 OTP ≈ ₹0.20–0.25 per SMS + DLT registration |
| Database + RLS | **Started (S0c)**: identity, audit chain, heartbeat, storage migrations in `supabase/` | Supabase Postgres (ap-south-1 Mumbai), free plan to start; Pro ≈ US$25 (≈ ₹2,100)/month + compute for a live business (backups, no pausing) — **D1 decided** |
| Map tiles | **Real, but non-compliant**: public `tile.openstreetmap.org` (`MapCanvas.tsx:219`), not allowed for production traffic | MapTiler / Stadia / Ola Maps; ≈ ₹0 up to free tier, then ~₹1,500–4,000/month at small scale |
| Geocoding / routing | Missing (hand-off to Google Maps URLs; 020 uses its own heuristic) | Ola Maps or Google Routes; pay-per-use |
| Offline map packs | Missing | Protomaps PMTiles for Pune region (self-hosted file, ≈ free) |
| WhatsApp | Stand-in (templates, sends recorded only); `wa.me` links for manual share | Meta WhatsApp Cloud API via a BSP (Gupshup/Interakt/AiSensy); ≈ ₹0.11–0.80 per conversation by category |
| SMS | Stand-in | MSG91 with DLT templates |
| Payment links / gateway | Stand-in (084) | Razorpay / Cashfree; ~2% per transaction, UPI ~0% for small tickets |
| Payouts (164) | Stand-in | RazorpayX / Cashfree Payouts; ≈ ₹3–6 per transfer |
| Bank verification (penny-drop) | Simulated | Cashfree / Razorpay verification APIs; ≈ ₹1–3 per check |
| GSTIN lookup | Simulated | GSP API (e.g. Masters India / ClearTax); per-call or monthly |
| E-sign (076) | Drawn signature + demo OTP | Aadhaar e-sign via Leegality / Digio / SignDesk; ≈ ₹25–60 per sign |
| File storage (photos, videos, PDFs) | Data URLs inside the in-memory store | Supabase Storage / S3 Mumbai; ≈ ₹2 per GB-month |
| Push notifications | Missing (in-app bell only) | FCM (free) |
| Scheduler (heartbeat) | Runs only while a browser tab is open (`useFollowUpHeartbeat.ts`) | Server cron (Supabase pg_cron / Edge Function, or Cloud Scheduler) calling the same engine |
| Error tracking | Missing | Sentry (free tier) |

## H. Security and privacy audit

| # | Severity | Finding | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | Critical | Authentication is a public constant checked in the browser; anyone can sign in as any phone on record | `src/screens/003-otp/otp.types.ts:30` |
| H2 | Critical | Every authorisation rule (role checks, money gates, payout approval, permissions 192, demo blocking) runs in the browser | `memoryRepository.ts` is bundled to the client |
| H3 | Critical | No persistence; also means no backup is real (196 says so) | no storage calls in `memoryRepository.ts` |
| H4 | High | Full Aadhaar number stored | `src/data/types.ts:2691` |
| H5 | High | Personal data (phones, addresses, bank account numbers for seeds) ships in the JS bundle as seed | `src/data/seed.ts`, `memoryRepository.ts:13048` |
| H6 | Medium | ~~Recovery codes generated with `Math.random`~~ (fixed in S0b) | `memoryRepository.ts:28407` (use a CSPRNG server-side) |
| H7 | Medium | Public OSM tiles leak user viewport to a third party and breach its usage policy | `MapCanvas.tsx:219` |
| H8 | Low | Secrets scan clean; no `.env` files; `firebase.ts` reads `VITE_*` only | grep in appendix |
| H9 | Good | DPDP groundwork exists: consent register, data requests with SLA, retention policy, access package (194); session revoke and lost-device recovery (195); location consent gates writes | — |

Location handling: device position is asked best-effort and stored on the
user record (`User.location`) and site check-ins; 194 can withdraw location
consent and the four location writes obey it. Exact site coordinates are visible
to anyone the screen shows them to — there is no fuzzing or masking.

## I. Test, build and deploy audit

| Item | State |
|---|---|
| Unit / API / E2E tests | **None committed.** Verification during the build used ad-hoc Playwright scripts in `/tmp`, not kept. |
| CI | **None** (no `.github/`). |
| Type check | `npx tsc --noEmit` clean (run today). |
| Translation check | `node scripts/check-translations.mjs`: 204 files, 21,594 keys × 3 languages, complete and distinct (run today). |
| Build | `vite build`; `dist/` is git-ignored. |
| Deploy | `vercel.json` SPA rewrite; Vercel previews run on PR #1. |
| Environments, migrations, backups, error tracking | None. |
| Bundle | One 33k-line repository module is shipped to every client (performance item for S10). |

## J. Conversion plan

Ordered vertical slices, adapted to this codebase. The key lever is that every
screen already talks only to the `Repository` interface (876 methods): a server
implementation can replace the in-memory one **module by module** without
touching screens, while the in-memory one stays as the test double and Demo Mode.

| Slice | Scope here | Depends on | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| **S0a** Fix the fakes that need no backend | 005/006/008 submit to the repository (no more data loss); Aadhaar: stop storing the full number; 404 uses `navigate`; 403 screen; remove `/supplier` leftover; 020 oddity; move 6 localStorage domain stores into the repository; one shared validation module | — | S |
| **S0b** Test + CI harness | Vitest for pure rules (pricing, payout split, aging, validators, hash chain); Playwright smoke per role; GitHub Actions running tsc, translations, tests, and a **no-mock guard** (banned patterns outside seed/test) | — | M |
| **S0c** Backend foundation | Postgres (+PostGIS) with migrations, phone-OTP auth, RLS per role, `isDemo` separation, append-only event table with the 187 hash chain moved server-side, server cron calling the follow-up engine, file storage, Sentry | **D1** | L |
| **S0d** HTTP repository | `httpRepository` implementing `Repository`; move rules server-side (the pure `src/features/*` modules run unchanged in Node); feature flag per module to switch from memory → server | S0c | L, incremental |
| S1–S9 | Move modules onto the server in this order: auth/users/sessions (001–010, 192, 195) → leads/CRM (031–050) → quotes/deals/payments (061–090) → suppliers/logistics (091–120) → field work (121–140) → partners/training/payouts (141–170) → customer portal (171–180) → automation/settings (181–200) | S0d | L each |
| S10 | Hardening: map tiles provider, bundle split, low-end Android profile, a11y pass, backup-restore drill, load test, DPDP checklist | all | M |

Risks: the in-memory store relies on synchronous reads inside one function
(e.g. `syncX` loops that read and write many collections); on a server these
become transactions and must be re-checked for races. The heartbeat's 92 units
assume one process; a server cron must take a lock.

### Decisions (answered by the owner on 2026-10-10)

- **D1 — Backend: Supabase**, starting on the free plan ("if it is free"). The free plan is enough to build and try the app: 500 MB database, 50,000 monthly sign-ins, two projects. Its limits for a live business: a free project **pauses after a week with no activity**, has **no daily backups**, and Supabase's own second-step sign-in (multi-factor) is a paid-plan feature. The paid plan is US$25/month plus compute. **SMS sign-in codes are never free:** each one goes through an SMS provider (Twilio, MessageBird, Textlocal or Vonage are built in), and in India the message must match a DLT-registered template. Setup steps: `docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md`.
- **D2 — Product spec: the repo's own 200 specs** (`001_…md`–`200_…md`) are the spec. Conflicts C1–C6 are settled in favour of the repo.
- **D3 — Passwords: keep 009** (forgot password). Sign-in stays by one-time code; a password matters only where a person has set one, and 009's reset is what Supabase's own password reset will back in S1.
