# Prompt 121 of 200 — Technician Home / My Jobs Screen
**Module 13 of 20: Installation & Technician Module** · Screen 1 of 10 in this module

*Paste this into your AI Studio Build chat once Prompt 120 (Auto-Reconciliation Screen) is complete and working. Part of the AIEC 200-screen sequential build — see `000_README.md`.*

Continue building **ALL INDIA ELEVATORS COMPANY (AIEC)**, the mobile-first, multi-role elevator business platform for owner Mr. Prashant Vasant Wable. Boots on the ground, following a real elevator installation SOP grounded in Indian safety standards, with the photo/video evidence trail the brief explicitly requires. Several screens already exist in this build — do not rebuild, restyle, or restructure anything outside this one screen. If you need a shared component (a button style, a card, the Ascension Line progress element, the map component), extend or reuse the existing one rather than creating a second, inconsistent version of it.

Now build the **Technician Home / My Jobs Screen** screen, used by: **Technician**.

### Functional requirements
- Today's assigned job(s) front and center with site address, customer name, and current SOP stage, plus a prominent 'Start/Continue Job' action
- Upcoming scheduled jobs this week for planning purposes
- Quick stats: jobs completed this month, quality score, pending payout amount
- Emergency/Escalation SOS button always accessible from this home screen, matching the field-worker safety pattern used for surveyors

### Data this screen touches
- `technician_id`
- `todays_jobs[]`
- `upcoming_jobs[]`
- `monthly_completed_count`
- `current_quality_score`

### Business logic & automation rules
- This is the technician's true home screen, mirroring the Surveyor Home screen's design philosophy — one tap to the most important current action, since field workers need speed and clarity over deep navigation
- Job list here reads directly from the same job/schedule records created by the Delivery Scheduling screen's confirmed-delivery-date trigger, never a separately maintained technician calendar
- Quality score shown here matches exactly what appears in the Admin-facing Worker Performance Leaderboard, ensuring the technician sees the same number Admin is evaluating them on

### Edge cases & validation to handle
- Technician has multiple jobs scheduled for overlapping times (a scheduling conflict): this should have been prevented upstream by the Route Optimization/assignment logic, but if it occurs, flag it clearly here rather than silently showing an impossible dual schedule
- No jobs scheduled today (a legitimately light day): show a clear, non-alarming empty state rather than implying something is wrong
- Technician is part of a multi-technician job where they're not the lead: clearly indicate their specific role/tasks within the shared job rather than showing an ambiguous full-job view identical to the lead technician's

### UI / design requirements
**AIEC Design System — "Alabaster & Ascension" (premium royal-white theme)**
- Palette: Alabaster White #F8F6F1 base, pure White #FFFFFF cards, Charcoal Ink #2A2723 text, Antique Gold #B8873D primary accent, Royal Emerald #0E4B3D secondary accent. Keep Error Red #B23B3B reserved strictly for genuine errors/safety alerts — never decorative.
- Type (Latin/English): "Fraunces" (serif, Google Font) for headings/hero numbers, "Plus Jakarta Sans" (Google Font) for all UI/body text, "IBM Plex Mono" tabular figures for money and KPI numbers.
- Type (Devanagari/Hindi & Marathi): "Fraunces" and "Plus Jakarta Sans" do NOT cover Devanagari glyphs — never let Hindi/Marathi text silently fall back to a generic system font. Pair "Martel" (Google Font) for headings and "Hind" (Google Font) for UI/body text in Hindi or Marathi, matching the same heading/body weight relationship as the Latin pair. Keep IBM Plex Mono for all numerals in every language — India's digital finance UI uses Western digits (0-9) regardless of the surrounding script, so amounts don't need a separate numeral font per language. All user-facing text (labels, buttons, headings, messages, notification templates) must render in the user's selected language (English / Hindi / Marathi) via the app's translation system — never hardcoded in one language.
- Icons: Phosphor Icons or Lucide, thin 1.5px line-weight, rounded caps, tinted Royal Emerald by default and Antique Gold when active/selected.
- Cards: 16-20px corner radius, soft ambient shadow (never a harsh flat drop-shadow), 1px hairline border tinted gold at ~15% opacity.
- Grid: 8pt spacing throughout, mobile-first single column, 16-24px screen margins, sticky bottom action bar for primary CTAs, minimum 48x48px touch targets.
- Theme modes: build every color as a CSS custom property (`--color-bg`, `--color-surface`, `--color-text-primary`, `--color-text-secondary`, `--color-accent-primary`, `--color-accent-secondary`, `--color-success`, `--color-warning`, `--color-error`, `--color-border`) — never a hardcoded hex value in a component — so the whole app can switch instantly between 4 modes, stored as the signed-in user's own saved preference: **Light/Alabaster** (default — the warm-ivory palette above), **Snow White** (a crisper, cooler, brighter variant — pure `#FFFFFF` background, near-black `#1F2124` text, tighter shadows), **Dark** (warm near-black `#1A1815` background and `#242019` cards, soft off-white `#F0EDE6` text, and *brightened* accent colors — gold `#D4A855`, emerald `#2E9B78` — since the light-mode gold/emerald values lose contrast on a dark background), and **System** (follows the device's own OS-level light/dark setting). Full token values for all four modes live in `000_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — use them exactly, don't invent new ones per screen.
- Signature element — "the Ascension Line": a thin gold vertical rail that fills upward as progress is made, literally a stylized elevator floor-indicator. Use it for every stage-based UI in the app: CRM pipeline, installation SOP steps, onboarding wizards, training progress, negotiation rounds. This is the one motif that should appear, consistently styled, across the entire app, and it should use the `--color-accent-primary` token so it looks correct in every theme mode automatically.
- Motion: subtle and purposeful only — a completed Ascension Line step gets a brief warm glow, cards fade-and-rise on load. No bouncy/spring physics; this is a premium, safety-adjacent brand, not a playful consumer app.
- Voice: confident, clear, warm but not casual, in whichever of the three languages is active. Save exclamation marks for genuine celebratory moments (a deal won, a badge earned).

**Layout-specific guidance for this screen (layout pattern: dashboard):** Card-based grid: 2 columns on mobile, 3-4 on wider viewports. Give the single most important figure top-left reading position. Every KPI card follows the same anatomy — small label, large "Fraunces" or "IBM Plex Mono" number, small trend arrow with percentage — so the eye learns the pattern once and reads every card instantly thereafter. Every card should feel tappable (subtle shadow lift on press) and lead somewhere more detailed. Use skeleton-loading placeholders matching each card's real shape while data loads, never a blank space or a lone centered spinner. Support pull-to-refresh on mobile.

### This screen is done when:
- [ ] A technician can see and start today's most important job within one tap of opening the app
- [ ] Every stat shown here is consistent with what Admin sees about this technician elsewhere
- [ ] The screen matches the AIEC Alabaster & Ascension design system (colors, type, the Ascension Line motif where applicable) rather than a generic default theme
- [ ] Loading, empty, and error states are all explicitly designed, not left blank or default
- [ ] The screen is fully usable at a mobile viewport width first, then adapted upward for wider screens

### Scope for this prompt
Touch only what's needed for the Technician Home / My Jobs Screen screen and any shared component it must genuinely reuse. Do not modify unrelated screens, do not restyle already-built screens "while you're in there," and do not refactor the data model beyond what this screen genuinely requires. If a larger refactor actually seems necessary, stop and say so rather than doing it silently.
