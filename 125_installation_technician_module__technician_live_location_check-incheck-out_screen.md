Continue building **ALL INDIA ELEVATORS COMPANY (AIEC)**, the mobile-first, multi-role elevator business platform for owner Mr. Prashant Vasant Wable. Boots on the ground, following a real elevator installation SOP grounded in Indian safety standards, with the photo/video evidence trail the brief explicitly requires. Several screens already exist in this build — do not rebuild, restyle, or restructure anything outside this one screen. If you need a shared component (a button style, a card, the Ascension Line progress element, the map component), extend or reuse the existing one rather than creating a second, inconsistent version of it.

Now build the **Technician Live Location Check-In/Check-Out Screen** screen, used by: **Technician**.

### Functional requirements
- Simple check-in action when arriving on-site (GPS-verified against the job's site address, matching the same geo-verification pattern used for surveyor lead capture) and check-out when leaving
- Running on-site duration shown live during an active check-in
- Multi-day job support: check in and out each day the job spans, building a complete on-site time record for this installation
- Automatic notification to Admin's Live Map if checkout happens with SOP steps still incomplete, per the Admin Map module's Technician Detail View logic

### Data this screen touches
- `job_id`
- `checkin_timestamp`
- `checkin_lat_lng`
- `checkout_timestamp`
- `onsite_duration`

### Business logic & automation rules
- Check-in GPS verification uses the same configurable-radius geo-matching logic as the Surveyor's lead capture duplicate-detection, applied here to confirm genuine on-site presence rather than a false remote check-in
- This is the exact data source read by the Admin Map module's Technician Live Tracking Detail View and by the Job Detail screen's on-site status, so there's one true check-in/check-out record used consistently everywhere it's referenced
- Total on-site duration across a job's full history feeds into realistic future timeline-setting (how long does a typical installation of this configuration actually take), informing customer-facing expectations set during the sales process over time

### Edge cases & validation to handle
- GPS accuracy is poor at a specific site (common in dense urban construction with tall surrounding structures): apply the same accuracy-aware confidence handling used in the Surveyor Site Visit Verification screen rather than a rigid, overly strict single-radius rule
- Technician forgets to formally check out at end of day: prompt them the next time they open the app rather than leaving an indefinitely 'still checked in' state that would distort on-site duration data
- Multi-technician job where team members arrive/leave at different times: track each technician's individual check-in/out independently rather than treating the job as having one shared, blended presence record

### UI / design requirements
**AIEC Design System — "Alabaster & Ascension" (premium royal-white theme)**
- Palette: Alabaster White #F8F6F1 base, pure White #FFFFFF cards, Charcoal Ink #2A2723 text, Antique Gold #B8873D primary accent, Royal Emerald #0E4B3D secondary accent. Keep Error Red #B23B3B reserved strictly for genuine errors/safety alerts — never decorative.
- Type (Latin/English): "Fraunces" (serif, Google Font) for headings/hero numbers, "Plus Jakarta Sans" (Google Font) for all UI/body text, "IBM Plex Mono" tabular figures for money and KPI numbers.
- Type (Devanagari/Hindi & Marathi): "Fraunces" and "Plus Jakarta Sans" do NOT cover Devanagari glyphs — never let Hindi/Marathi text silently fall back to a generic system font. Pair "Martel" (Google Font) for headings and "Hind" (Google Font) for UI/body text in Hindi or Marathi, matching the same heading/body weight relationship as the Latin pair. Keep IBM Plex Mono for all numerals in every language — India's digital finance UI uses Western digits (0-9) regardless of the surrounding script, so amounts don't need a separate numeral font per language. All user-facing text (labels, buttons, headings, messages, notification templates) must render in the user's selected language (English / Hindi / Marathi) via the app's translation system — never hardcoded in one language.
- Icons: Phosphor Icons or Lucide, thin 1.5px line-weight, rounded caps, tinted Royal Emerald by default and Antique Gold when active/selected.
- Cards: 16-20px corner radius, soft ambient shadow (never a harsh flat drop-shadow), 1px hairline border tinted gold at ~15% opacity.
- Grid: 8pt spacing throughout, mobile-first single column, 16-24px screen margins, sticky bottom action bar for primary CTAs, minimum 48x48px touch targets.
- Theme modes: build every color as a CSS custom property (`--color-bg`, `--color-surface`, `--color-text-primary`, `--color-text-secondary`, `--color-accent-primary`, `--color-accent-secondary`, `--color-success`, `--color-warning`, `--color-error`, `--color-border`) — never a hardcoded hex value in a component — so the whole app can switch instantly between 4 modes, stored as the signed-in user's own saved preference: **Light/Alabaster** (default — the warm-ivory palette above), **Snow White** (a crisper, cooler, brighter variant — pure `#FFFFFF` background, near-black `#1F2124` text, tighter shadows), **Dark** (warm near-black `#1A1815` background and `#242019` cards, soft off-white `#F0EDE6` text, and *brightened* accent colors — gold `#D4A855`, emerald `#2E9B78` — since the light-mode gold/emerald values lose contrast on a dark background), and **System** (follows the device's own OS-level light/dark setting). Full token values for all four modes live in `000_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — use them exactly, don't invent new ones per screen.
- Signature element — "the Ascension Line": a thin gold vertical rail that fills upward as progress is made, literally a stylized elevator floor-indicator. Use it for every stage-based UI in the app: CRM pipeline, installation SOP steps, onboarding wizards, training progress, negotiation rounds. This is the one motif that should appear, consistently styled, across the entire app, and it should use the `--color-accent-primary` token so it looks correct in every theme mode automatically.
- Motion: subtle and purposeful only — a completed Ascension Line step gets a brief warm glow, cards fade-and-rise on load. No bouncy/spring physics; this is a premium, safety-adjacent brand, not a playful consumer app.
- Voice: confident, clear, warm but not casual, in whichever of the three languages is active. Save exclamation marks for genuine celebratory moments (a deal won, a badge earned).

**Layout-specific guidance for this screen (layout pattern: form):** Single-column layout with generous label-above-input spacing following the 8pt grid. Validate inline as the user types wherever practical, not only on submit — show a small success check the instant a field like a phone number or IFSC code becomes valid. Group related fields under a subtle section header with a Gold Hairline divider rather than one undifferentiated long list. For any form with more than 4 fields, auto-save a draft so a partial entry is never lost to an app close or a connectivity drop. Primary action button sticky at the bottom on mobile, full-width, disabled (not hidden) until required fields are valid so the user always sees what's left to do.

### This screen is done when:
- [ ] Every job has an accurate, geo-verified record of actual on-site time, consistent with what Admin sees on the Live Map
- [ ] Incomplete-SOP checkouts are proactively flagged rather than silently accepted
- [ ] The screen matches the AIEC Alabaster & Ascension design system (colors, type, the Ascension Line motif where applicable) rather than a generic default theme
- [ ] Loading, empty, and error states are all explicitly designed, not left blank or default
- [ ] The screen is fully usable at a mobile viewport width first, then adapted upward for wider screens

### Scope for this prompt
Touch only what's needed for the Technician Live Location Check-In/Check-Out Screen screen and any shared component it must genuinely reuse. Do not modify unrelated screens, do not restyle already-built screens "while you're in there," and do not refactor the data model beyond what this screen genuinely requires. If a larger refactor actually seems necessary, stop and say so rather than doing it silently.
