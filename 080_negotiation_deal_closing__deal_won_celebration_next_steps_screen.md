Continue building **ALL INDIA ELEVATORS COMPANY (AIEC)**, the mobile-first, multi-role elevator business platform for owner Mr. Prashant Vasant Wable. Where the brief's 'auto-negotiate with customer and make deal automatically' becomes real: a bounded, monitored bot backed by a human escalation path and a clean contract close. Several screens already exist in this build — do not rebuild, restyle, or restructure anything outside this one screen. If you need a shared component (a button style, a card, the Ascension Line progress element, the map component), extend or reuse the existing one rather than creating a second, inconsistent version of it.

Now build the **Deal Won — Celebration & Next Steps Screen** screen, used by: **Admin, Sales, Surveyor**.

### Functional requirements
- Internal celebratory moment shown to the sales user and the original capturing surveyor when a deal they were involved in closes, reinforcing the incentive-driven culture the brief describes
- Clear breakdown of commission/reward implications for everyone involved in this specific deal (surveyor capture bonus, conversion bonus, any active contest progress)
- One-tap acknowledgment that also serves as a lightweight moment to prompt for internal feedback ('anything about this deal we should learn from?')
- Link straight into the newly created Supplier Purchase Order and Payment Schedule records for anyone wanting to follow the deal's next phase

### Data this screen touches
- `deal_id`
- `involved_staff_ids[]`
- `commission_summary_per_staff`
- `internal_feedback_note`
- `celebration_acknowledged_flag`

### Business logic & automation rules
- This screen is explicitly about internal motivation and team culture, separate from the customer-facing Deal Closure Confirmation screen — the two serve different audiences with different tones by design
- Commission figures shown here must exactly match what later appears in each involved staff member's own Commission & Rewards Tracker, since this is a preview of that same ledger, not a separate calculation
- Optional feedback captured here feeds into a lightweight internal knowledge base Admin can review periodically, supporting continuous improvement without adding process overhead to the excited moment of a win

### Edge cases & validation to handle
- A deal involved an unusual number of contributors (e.g., a reassigned lead with two surveyors historically involved): correctly and fairly attribute commission summaries to everyone with a legitimate claim, consistent with the Lead Reassignment screen's fairness rules
- Staff member is offline when the deal closes: queue the celebratory notification for their next app open rather than only a fleeting real-time push they might miss
- Internal feedback note contains sensitive information: ensure it's visible only to appropriate Admin-level roles, not broadly shared

### UI / design requirements
**AIEC Design System — "Alabaster & Ascension" (premium royal-white theme)**
- Palette: Alabaster White #F8F6F1 base, pure White #FFFFFF cards, Charcoal Ink #2A2723 text, Antique Gold #B8873D primary accent, Royal Emerald #0E4B3D secondary accent. Keep Error Red #B23B3B reserved strictly for genuine errors/safety alerts — never decorative.
- Type (Latin/English): "Fraunces" (serif, Google Font) for headings/hero numbers, "Plus Jakarta Sans" (Google Font) for all UI/body text, "IBM Plex Mono" tabular figures for money and KPI numbers.
- Type (Devanagari/Hindi & Marathi): "Fraunces" and "Plus Jakarta Sans" do NOT cover Devanagari glyphs — never let Hindi/Marathi text silently fall back to a generic system font. Pair "Martel" (Google Font) for headings and "Hind" (Google Font) for UI/body text in Hindi or Marathi, matching the same heading/body weight relationship as the Latin pair. Keep IBM Plex Mono for all numerals in every language — India's digital finance UI uses Western digits (0-9) regardless of the surrounding script, so amounts don't need a separate numeral font per language. All user-facing text (labels, buttons, headings, messages, notification templates) must render in the user's selected language (English / Hindi / Marathi) via the app's translation system — never hardcoded in one language.
- Icons: Phosphor Icons or Lucide, thin 1.5px line-weight, rounded caps, tinted Royal Emerald by default and Antique Gold when active/selected.
- Cards: 16-20px corner radius, soft ambient shadow (never a harsh flat drop-shadow), 1px hairline border tinted gold at ~15% opacity.
- Grid: 8pt spacing throughout, mobile-first single column, 16-24px screen margins, sticky bottom action bar for primary CTAs, minimum 48x48px touch targets.
- Theme modes: build every color as a CSS custom property (`--color-bg`, `--color-surface`, `--color-text-primary`, `--color-text-secondary`, `--color-accent-primary`, `--color-accent-secondary`, `--color-success`, `--color-warning`, `--color-error`, `--color-border`) — never a hardcoded hex value in a component — so the whole app can switch instantly between 7 modes, stored as the signed-in user's own saved preference: **Light/Alabaster** (default — the warm-ivory palette above), **Snow White** (a crisper, cooler, brighter variant — pure `#FFFFFF` background, near-black `#1F2124` text, tighter shadows), **Dark** (warm near-black `#1A1815` background and `#242019` cards, soft off-white `#F0EDE6` text, brightened gold `#D4A855` and emerald `#2E9B78` accents), **Orbital** (a mission-control mood — deep space-black `#0B0E14` background, monospace telemetry-style labels, a fine dot-grid texture, brightened gold `#D9AE5C` and emerald `#35B48A` accents), **Lithium** (a matte, automotive-dashboard mood — flat near-black `#101012` surfaces, oversized clean numerals, desaturated matte gold `#C99A52` and emerald `#2E8968` accents, almost no shadow), **Pure** (an extreme-minimalist mood — pure white `#FFFFFF` background, hairline dividers instead of shadows, maximum whitespace, the same gold `#B8873D`/emerald `#0E4B3D` as Light mode used far more sparingly), and **System** (follows the device's own OS-level light/dark setting, mapping to Light/Alabaster or Dark). All 7 modes keep the *same* AIEC gold-and-emerald brand identity underneath — only mood, texture, density, and typography change between them, never the core brand colors, so the app never looks like it's borrowed someone else's visual identity. Full token values for all seven modes live in `000_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — use them exactly, don't invent new ones per screen.
- Signature element — "the Ascension Line": a thin gold vertical rail that fills upward as progress is made, literally a stylized elevator floor-indicator. Use it for every stage-based UI in the app: CRM pipeline, installation SOP steps, onboarding wizards, training progress, negotiation rounds. This is the one motif that should appear, consistently styled, across the entire app, and it should use the `--color-accent-primary` token so it looks correct in every theme mode automatically.
- Motion: subtle and purposeful only — a completed Ascension Line step gets a brief warm glow, cards fade-and-rise on load. No bouncy/spring physics; this is a premium, safety-adjacent brand, not a playful consumer app.
- Voice: confident, clear, warm but not casual, in whichever of the three languages is active. Save exclamation marks for genuine celebratory moments (a deal won, a badge earned).

**Layout-specific guidance for this screen (layout pattern: detail):** Lead with a hero header carrying the record's key identifying information (name, status badge, one or two headline stats). Break dense content into clear sections — tabs for genuinely separate categories of information, simple stacked sections with headers when the content is more linear. Any history/timeline section within a detail screen uses the vertical Ascension Line motif. Keep one clear primary action reachable via a sticky bottom bar or a prominent header button; secondary actions live in an overflow menu rather than competing visually with the primary one.

### This screen is done when:
- [ ] Everyone who contributed to a win sees clear, accurate recognition and commission impact
- [ ] The moment of winning a deal is emotionally distinct from, and doesn't get lost in, the more procedural customer-facing confirmation
- [ ] The screen matches the AIEC Alabaster & Ascension design system (colors, type, the Ascension Line motif where applicable) rather than a generic default theme
- [ ] Loading, empty, and error states are all explicitly designed, not left blank or default
- [ ] The screen is fully usable at a mobile viewport width first, then adapted upward for wider screens

### Scope for this prompt
Touch only what's needed for the Deal Won — Celebration & Next Steps Screen screen and any shared component it must genuinely reuse. Do not modify unrelated screens, do not restyle already-built screens "while you're in there," and do not refactor the data model beyond what this screen genuinely requires. If a larger refactor actually seems necessary, stop and say so rather than doing it silently.

## Module 8 Checkpoint — before you start the next module

You've now finished all 10 screens in **Module 8: Negotiation & Deal Closing**. Before moving on to Module 9:

1. Click through every screen you just built in this module, start to finish, once, as if you were the actual user.
2. Spot-check 2-3 of the most important screens from earlier modules — you don't need to re-test everything back to Prompt 001, just confirm nothing visibly broke.
3. If anything looks wrong, send one more small, targeted prompt to fix it now. Don't carry a visible bug forward into the next module — regressions compound, and they're far cheaper to fix the moment you spot them than 50 screens later.
4. Optional but recommended: this is a natural point to download a ZIP backup or note your current AI Studio checkpoint/version, so you always have a known-good rollback point behind you.

This costs about two minutes and saves far more than that in confused debugging later.
