# Prompt 037 of 200 — My Leads History Screen
**Module 4 of 20: Surveyor — Lead Capture** · Screen 7 of 10 in this module

*Paste this into your AI Studio Build chat once Prompt 036 (Lead Submission Confirmation & Incentive Preview Screen) is complete and working. Part of the AIEC 200-screen sequential build — see `000_README.md`.*

---

Continue building **ALL INDIA ELEVATORS COMPANY (AIEC)**, the mobile-first, multi-role elevator business platform for owner Mr. Prashant Vasant Wable. The literal front line: surveyors walking real construction sites, turning a building into a qualified lead in minutes, with commission as the motivator. Several screens already exist in this build — do not rebuild, restyle, or restructure anything outside this one screen. If you need a shared component (a button style, a card, the Ascension Line progress element, the map component), extend or reuse the existing one rather than creating a second, inconsistent version of it.

Now build the **My Leads History Screen** screen, used by: **Surveyor**.

### Functional requirements
- Chronological list of every lead this surveyor has ever captured, with current CRM stage shown as a colored tag (New, Contacted, Quoted, Negotiating, Won, Lost)
- Search and filter by date range, stage, or building name
- Tap into any lead to see its full journey and current status, read-only for the surveyor beyond their original capture
- Personal conversion-rate summary at the top

### Data this screen touches
- `lead_id`
- `capture_date`
- `current_stage`
- `building_name`
- `surveyor_personal_conversion_rate`

### Business logic & automation rules
- Surveyors see their own leads' current stage for transparency and motivation, but cannot edit CRM fields owned by the sales/negotiation stages — clear separation of who can change what
- Personal conversion rate is calculated the same way as the Admin-facing Conversion Rate screen, just scoped to this one surveyor, so the numbers always agree
- A lead that gets merged as someone else's duplicate still shows in this surveyor's history with a clear 'merged' status rather than vanishing

### Edge cases & validation to handle
- Very long-tenured surveyor with hundreds of historical leads: list must paginate/search well rather than becoming unusably long
- A lead's stage changes while the surveyor is viewing the list: reflect it on next refresh rather than requiring a full app restart
- Surveyor's own account role changed or they left and rejoined: history should persist correctly under their same identity

### UI / design requirements
**AIEC Design System — "Alabaster & Ascension" (premium royal-white theme)**
- Palette: Alabaster White #F8F6F1 base, pure White #FFFFFF cards, Charcoal Ink #2A2723 text, Antique Gold #B8873D primary accent, Royal Emerald #0E4B3D secondary accent. Keep Error Red #B23B3B reserved strictly for genuine errors/safety alerts — never decorative.
- Type (Latin/English): "Fraunces" (serif, Google Font) for headings/hero numbers, "Plus Jakarta Sans" (Google Font) for all UI/body text, "IBM Plex Mono" tabular figures for money and KPI numbers.
- Type (Devanagari/Hindi & Marathi): "Fraunces" and "Plus Jakarta Sans" do NOT cover Devanagari glyphs — never let Hindi/Marathi text silently fall back to a generic system font. Pair "Martel" (Google Font) for headings and "Hind" (Google Font) for UI/body text in Hindi or Marathi, matching the same heading/body weight relationship as the Latin pair. Keep IBM Plex Mono for all numerals in every language — India's digital finance UI uses Western digits (0-9) regardless of the surrounding script, so amounts don't need a separate numeral font per language. All user-facing text (labels, buttons, headings, messages, notification templates) must render in the user's selected language (English / Hindi / Marathi) via the app's translation system — never hardcoded in one language.
- Icons: Phosphor Icons or Lucide, thin 1.5px line-weight, rounded caps, tinted Royal Emerald by default and Antique Gold when active/selected.
- Cards: 16-20px corner radius, soft ambient shadow (never a harsh flat drop-shadow), 1px hairline border tinted gold at ~15% opacity.
- Grid: 8pt spacing throughout, mobile-first single column, 16-24px screen margins, sticky bottom action bar for primary CTAs, minimum 48x48px touch targets.
- Theme modes: build every color as a CSS custom property (`--color-bg`, `--color-surface`, `--color-text-primary`, `--color-text-secondary`, `--color-accent-primary`, `--color-accent-secondary`, `--color-success`, `--color-warning`, `--color-error`, `--color-border`) — never a hardcoded hex value in a component — so the whole app can switch instantly between 7 modes, stored as the signed-in user's own saved preference: **Light/Alabaster** (default — the warm-ivory palette above), **Snow White** (a crisper, cooler, brighter variant — pure `#FFFFFF` background, near-black `#1F2124` text, tighter shadows), **Dark** (warm near-black `#1A1815` background and `#242019` cards, soft off-white `#F0EDE6` text, brightened gold `#D4A855` and emerald `#2E9B78` accents), **Orbital** (a mission-control mood — deep space-black `#0B0E14` background, monospace telemetry-style labels, a fine dot-grid texture, brightened gold `#D9AE5C` and emerald `#35B48A` accents), **Lithium** (a matte, automotive-dashboard mood — flat near-black `#101012` surfaces, oversized clean numerals, desaturated matte gold `#C99A52` and emerald `#2E8968` accents, almost no shadow), **Pure** (an extreme-minimalist mood — pure white `#FFFFFF` background, hairline dividers instead of shadows, maximum whitespace, the same gold `#B8873D`/emerald `#0E4B3D` as Light mode used far more sparingly), and **System** (follows the device's own OS-level light/dark setting, mapping to Light/Alabaster or Dark). All 7 modes keep the *same* AIEC gold-and-emerald brand identity underneath — only mood, texture, density, and typography change between them, never the core brand colors, so the app never looks like it's borrowed someone else's visual identity. Full token values for all seven modes live in `000_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — use them exactly, don't invent new ones per screen.
- Signature element — "the Ascension Line": a thin gold vertical rail that fills upward as progress is made, literally a stylized elevator floor-indicator. Use it for every stage-based UI in the app: CRM pipeline, installation SOP steps, onboarding wizards, training progress, negotiation rounds. This is the one motif that should appear, consistently styled, across the entire app, and it should use the `--color-accent-primary` token so it looks correct in every theme mode automatically.
- Motion: subtle and purposeful only — a completed Ascension Line step gets a brief warm glow, cards fade-and-rise on load. No bouncy/spring physics; this is a premium, safety-adjacent brand, not a playful consumer app.
- Voice: confident, clear, warm but not casual, in whichever of the three languages is active. Save exclamation marks for genuine celebratory moments (a deal won, a badge earned).

**Layout-specific guidance for this screen (layout pattern: list):** Establish one consistent row anatomy (leading icon or avatar, primary line, secondary line, trailing status/value) and repeat it exactly across every row so the list reads instantly once learned. Sticky search/filter bar pinned above the scrolling content. Support swipe actions on mobile where a natural quick action exists (e.g., swipe to call, swipe to reassign). Design the empty state (zero results, zero data yet) with the same care as a populated list — a clear icon, one calm sentence, and a next action, never just blank space. Use skeleton row placeholders while loading, and paginate or virtualize any list that could realistically grow large.

### This screen is done when:
- [ ] A surveyor can trace exactly what happened to every lead they ever captured
- [ ] Personal stats here always match what Admin sees about this surveyor
- [ ] The screen matches the AIEC Alabaster & Ascension design system (colors, type, the Ascension Line motif where applicable) rather than a generic default theme
- [ ] Loading, empty, and error states are all explicitly designed, not left blank or default
- [ ] The screen is fully usable at a mobile viewport width first, then adapted upward for wider screens

### Scope for this prompt
Touch only what's needed for the My Leads History Screen screen and any shared component it must genuinely reuse. Do not modify unrelated screens, do not restyle already-built screens "while you're in there," and do not refactor the data model beyond what this screen genuinely requires. If a larger refactor actually seems necessary, stop and say so rather than doing it silently.
