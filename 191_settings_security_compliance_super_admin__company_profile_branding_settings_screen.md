Continue building **ALL INDIA ELEVATORS COMPANY (AIEC)**, the mobile-first, multi-role elevator business platform for owner Mr. Prashant Vasant Wable. The governance layer underneath everything else: branding, permissions, data privacy, and the master control panel befitting a single, trusted monitor of an enterprise-grade system. Several screens already exist in this build — do not rebuild, restyle, or restructure anything outside this one screen. If you need a shared component (a button style, a card, the Ascension Line progress element, the map component), extend or reuse the existing one rather than creating a second, inconsistent version of it.

Now build the **Company Profile & Branding Settings Screen** screen, used by: **Admin**.

### Functional requirements
- Central management of AIEC's core brand identity used throughout the app: company name (All India Elevators Company), owner/founder name (Mr. Prashant Vasant Wable), logo, and the premium royal-white theme's color and typography tokens
- Legal/registration details (GSTIN, registered address) referenced by invoices and contracts throughout the app
- Preview of how branding changes would appear across key customer-facing touchpoints (quotation, invoice, customer portal) before committing
- Version history for brand asset changes

### Data this screen touches
- `company_name`
- `owner_name`
- `gstin`
- `logo_asset`
- `theme_tokens{}`

### Business logic & automation rules
- This is the single source of truth for brand identity referenced by every other screen that displays AIEC's name, logo, or theme (Quotation Template, Digital Contract Generator, Invoice Generator, Customer Home Dashboard) — a branding update here propagates consistently everywhere rather than needing separate updates in multiple places
- GSTIN and registered address configured here are the exact values used in every generated invoice and formal document, so this is a genuinely important compliance-relevant configuration, not merely cosmetic branding
- Preview-before-commit for branding changes protects against an inadvertent brand inconsistency reaching real customers, given how central consistent premium branding is to the business's stated positioning

### Edge cases & validation to handle
- A branding change (e.g., a refreshed logo) needs to apply only prospectively, with already-issued historical documents (old invoices, old contracts) correctly retaining the branding that was active when they were originally generated, consistent with the immutability principle applied to those documents elsewhere in the app
- GSTIN or registered address changes due to a genuine business registration change: ensure this transition is handled carefully given its direct impact on tax compliance for all future invoices, distinct from a purely cosmetic branding tweak
- Multiple theme token changes at once risk an inconsistent visual result if not holistically previewed: ensure the preview genuinely reflects the combined effect of all pending changes together, not each token change previewed in isolation

### UI / design requirements
**AIEC Design System — "Alabaster & Ascension" (premium royal-white theme)**
- Palette: Alabaster White #F8F6F1 base, pure White #FFFFFF cards, Charcoal Ink #2A2723 text, Antique Gold #B8873D primary accent, Royal Emerald #0E4B3D secondary accent. Keep Error Red #B23B3B reserved strictly for genuine errors/safety alerts — never decorative.
- Type (Latin/English): "Fraunces" (serif, Google Font) for headings/hero numbers, "Plus Jakarta Sans" (Google Font) for all UI/body text, "IBM Plex Mono" tabular figures for money and KPI numbers.
- Type (Devanagari/Hindi & Marathi): "Fraunces" and "Plus Jakarta Sans" do NOT cover Devanagari glyphs — never let Hindi/Marathi text silently fall back to a generic system font. Pair "Martel" (Google Font) for headings and "Hind" (Google Font) for UI/body text in Hindi or Marathi, matching the same heading/body weight relationship as the Latin pair. Keep IBM Plex Mono for all numerals in every language — India's digital finance UI uses Western digits (0-9) regardless of the surrounding script, so amounts don't need a separate numeral font per language. All user-facing text (labels, buttons, headings, messages, notification templates) must render in the user's selected language (English / Hindi / Marathi) via the app's translation system — never hardcoded in one language.
- Icons: Phosphor Icons or Lucide, thin 1.5px line-weight, rounded caps, tinted Royal Emerald by default and Antique Gold when active/selected.
- Cards: 16-20px corner radius, soft ambient shadow (never a harsh flat drop-shadow), 1px hairline border tinted gold at ~15% opacity.
- Grid: 8pt spacing throughout, mobile-first single column, 16-24px screen margins, sticky bottom action bar for primary CTAs, minimum 48x48px touch targets.
- Theme modes: build every color as a CSS custom property (`--color-bg`, `--color-surface`, `--color-text-primary`, `--color-text-secondary`, `--color-accent-primary`, `--color-accent-secondary`, `--color-success`, `--color-warning`, `--color-error`, `--color-border`) — never a hardcoded hex value in a component — so the whole app can switch instantly between 4 modes, stored as the signed-in user's own saved preference: **Light/Alabaster** (default — the warm-ivory palette above), **Snow White** (a crisper, cooler, brighter variant — pure `#FFFFFF` background, near-black `#1F2124` text, tighter shadows), **Dark** (warm near-black `#1A1815` background and `#242019` cards, soft off-white `#F0EDE6` text, and *brightened* accent colors — gold `#D4A855`, emerald `#2E9B78` — since the light-mode gold/emerald values lose contrast on a dark background), and **System** (follows the device's own OS-level light/dark setting). Full token values for all four modes live in `000_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — use them exactly, don't invent new ones per screen.
- Signature element — "the Ascension Line": a thin gold vertical rail that fills upward as progress is made, literally a stylized elevator floor-indicator. Use it for every stage-based UI in the app: CRM pipeline, installation SOP steps, onboarding wizards, training progress, negotiation rounds. This is the one motif that should appear, consistently styled, across the entire app, and it should use the `--color-accent-primary` token so it looks correct in every theme mode automatically.
- Motion: subtle and purposeful only — a completed Ascension Line step gets a brief warm glow, cards fade-and-rise on load. No bouncy/spring physics; this is a premium, safety-adjacent brand, not a playful consumer app.
- Voice: confident, clear, warm but not casual, in whichever of the three languages is active. Save exclamation marks for genuine celebratory moments (a deal won, a badge earned).

**Layout-specific guidance for this screen (layout pattern: settings):** Group related settings under clear section headers with generous spacing between groups — settings screens fail when everything looks like one undifferentiated list. Toggle switches right-aligned and consistently sized. Always show the current value next to a setting's name (e.g., "Reminder cadence: 3 days before due") rather than hiding it until tapped into a sub-screen. Any destructive or high-consequence action (deactivating a partner, changing a margin floor, revoking a session) gets distinct visual treatment (e.g., Error Red text or icon) and a confirmation step — never sits visually identical to a routine, reversible setting.

### This screen is done when:
- [ ] Brand identity is consistent everywhere in the app from one governed configuration source
- [ ] Compliance-relevant details (GSTIN, address) are correctly and consistently reflected in every generated formal document
- [ ] The screen matches the AIEC Alabaster & Ascension design system (colors, type, the Ascension Line motif where applicable) rather than a generic default theme
- [ ] Loading, empty, and error states are all explicitly designed, not left blank or default
- [ ] The screen is fully usable at a mobile viewport width first, then adapted upward for wider screens

### Scope for this prompt
Touch only what's needed for the Company Profile & Branding Settings Screen screen and any shared component it must genuinely reuse. Do not modify unrelated screens, do not restyle already-built screens "while you're in there," and do not refactor the data model beyond what this screen genuinely requires. If a larger refactor actually seems necessary, stop and say so rather than doing it silently.
